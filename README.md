Catapult is a video game built into a realistic environment of living on a game hosting site. When following the deployed link the user is taking to the home page. From there the user can select from the possible games to play, in this case just Catapult. The user is navigated to the game's page where a game can be started. The rules and score are visible to the user. Once the game is won the user has the option to play again or quit.

Catapult is a game built to mirror the gameplay of "Crush the Castle" or "Angry Birds", two physics bases games. Catapult is built on top of the Matter.js physics engine which provides the game's gravity and collision dynamics. The engine is in its alpha stage but provides plenty of functionality for a simple physics game.

Thanks for playing!

Catapult is deployed at: mworks4905-catapult.surge.sh
